IN NO EVENT SHALL BRIGHTWORKS ENGINEERING NOR ITS PARTNERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF BRIGHTMIND OR OTHER DEALINGS THEREOF.
### Liability for contents
As a service provider, Brightworks Engineering is responsible for its content on all websites and applications. However, Brightworks Engineering as a service provider is not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected.

# Privacy Policy
 
## General notes and information
This web application (hereinafter “brightmind”) was designed and developed by Mr. Jonas Triebel on behalf of Brightworks Mühendislik San. Ve Tic. Ltd. Şti. (hereinafter “Brightworks Engineering”). Brightworks Engineering takes the protection of your personal and sensitive data very seriously. Brightworks Engineering treats your personal and other sensitive data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. When you use brightmind, various personal and other sensitive data can be collected. Personal data, in particular, is data with which website visitors can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data can be collected and what it is used for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done. Brightworks Engineering likes to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Therefore, full protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
 
## Responsible contact person
The responsible person in terms of data protection laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is:
Mahir Ziyrek
email:  mahir.ziyrek(at)bwetr.com
 
## Data storage in general 
Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy policy, your personal and sensitive data will be stored until the purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent for data processing, your data will be deleted unless Brightworks Engineering has other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons no longer apply.
 
## Data subject rights
You can request such a deletion at any time under the contact details provided above, as well as exercise other following rights at any time:
Information about your data stored by or on behalf of Brightworks Engineering and its processing (Art. 15 GDPR),
Correction of incorrect personal and otherwise sensitive data (Art. 16 GDPR),
Deletion of your data stored by or on behalf of Brightworks Engineering (Art. 17 GDPR),
Restriction of data processing if Brightworks Engineering and/or its data processors are not yet allowed to delete your data due to legal obligations (Art. 18 GDPR),
objection to the processing of your data by or on behalf of Brightworks Engineering (Art. 21 GDPR),
data portability, provided you have consented to the data processing or have concluded a contract with Brightworks Engineering (Art. 20 GDPR).
If you have given Brightworks Engineering consent, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.
You may at any time lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, e.g. the competent supervisory authority in the federal state of your residence or the authority responsible for Brightworks Engineering. 
 
## Hosting
Brightmind is hosted by third-party service providers. The personal data collected on this website is stored on servers of these external, third-party hosters. An exemplary list of data generated and collected through browsers can be found in the following section. Brightworks Engineering and/or its data processors have a legitimate interest in collecting this data for a fast and efficient provision of brightmind (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
While in beta phase, brightmind can be hosted by GitHub, Inc. (“hereinafter Github”). Github is a provider of version control for software development but also internet hosting, i.a. for websites via its service GitHub Pages, based in the United States of America (U.S.). Since American data protection laws are considered insufficient, GitHub relies on so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) approved by the European Commission as a legal mechanism for data transfers from the EU.
SCCs are contractual commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of such data. GitHub adopted SCCs so that the necessary data flows can be protected when transferred outside the EU to countries which have not been deemed by the European Commission to adequately protect personal data, including protecting data transfers to the United States. Please see Github’s data protection agreement (https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-agreement) and global privacy practices (https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/global-privacy-practices) especially for further information.
Brightworks Engineering and its data processors have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR to use the most renowned, leading and stable version control and hosting provider for its web service in development to make quick changes and react to users’ feedback.
 
## Collection of general information (server log files)
Regardless of hosting providers, information of a general nature is generated by your browser and automatically collected, even if you do not actively submit any information. This information, so-called server log files, can include for example
- browser type and version,
- type of device used,
- operating system used,
- referrer URL (i.e. previously visited website),
- host name of the accessing computer,
- time of the server request,
- IP address
As stated in the previous section, the processing of the listed data is based on a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, as it serves in particular to ensure a smooth connection establishment of websites and a smooth use thereof, the evaluation of system security and stability, as well as to optimize the accessed website.
Brightworks Engineering does not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. If at all, information of this kind would be statistically evaluated anonymously in order to optimize the brightmind web application and the technologies behind them. Brightworks Engineering explicitly does not combine this data with other data sources. The data is stored and received by an external hosting provider as stated above. The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. This is generally the case for the data used to provide the website when the respective session has ended.
The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of brightmind cannot be guaranteed and individual services and services might not be available or only available to a limited extent. An objection is therefore excluded.
 
## Google Drive
During development, Mr. Jonas Triebel has created a virtual drive  on the Google Cloud Platform (“Google Drive”) provided by Google LLC (hereinafter “Google”).
When submitting your personal (e-mail address) and sensitive data (CSVs and arrays containing design, material and process parameters) on brightmind, your data will be stored on this virtual drive. Brightworks Engineering and/or its data processors process your data to provide its core service of predicting process parameters based on this data. Your email address will be stored on Google Drive and is used to grant access and deliver the results as part of the service in a most secure way.
After processing your data, it will remain on Google Drive. Brightworks Engineering has a legitimate interest in storing this data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR to prevent misuse of brightmind, e.g. submitting random parameters that will corrupt Mr. Jonas Triebel’s algorithm behind the web application and services, as well as to comply with local legal requirements. By submitting your sensitive data, you explicitly agree not only to your data being stored but you also grant permission to Brightworks Engineering and its data processors to use your data as training data to improve and optimize the aforementioned algorithm and brightmind in general. You can revoke your consent to the storage and processing of your personal and sensitive data at any time with effect for the future by informing the responsible person named on this website of your revocation. Your data then will no longer be stored on Google Drive given compliance to legal regulations. Please be aware that improvements made to the service based i.a. on your sensitive data will and can technically not be undone and therefore are not affected by your revocation.
After submitting your data via brightmind, a web-based spreasheet will be rendered from the Google Drive within the web application in a so-called iframe. An iframe or inline frame is a website (in this case the web-based spreadsheet) integrated in another website or application (brightmind). As the spreadsheet is originally hosted by Google, mustermind cannot rule out that server log files from your browser are sent to Google. Google relies on standard contractual clauses and/or model contract clauses approved by the European Commission as a means of ensuring adequate protection when transferring data outside of the EEA and UK. Please refer to Google’s privacy policy and data transfer frameworks (https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?hl=en-US) for more information.
  
## Feedback (Convas)
Brightmind uses Convas as an external service provider to let you leave your feedback and vote for other users’ feedback to actively participate in brightmind’s product development process. Convas is provided by Basecanvas AB (hereinafter “Convas”), an internationally acting company based in Sweden.
Feedback and resulting roadmap visualization are hosted by Convas (however, on a subdomain titled “mustermind”). In order to leave your feedback Convas asks you to sign up with your personal data, i.e. e-mail adress only. As an internationally acting company, Convas states in its privacy policy, that your data might be forwarded to other countries, explicitly mentioning the United States of America. For further information, please read Convas’ privacy policy (https://convas.io/privacy-policy) before signing up to the service.
 
## SSL or TLS encryption
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send mustermind, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" as well as by the lock symbol in your browser line.  If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to mustermind cannot be read by third parties.
 
## Cookies
Cookies are small text files that do not cause any damage to your device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (so-called session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser.
Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain functions of a website would not work without them. If you disable cookies, the functionality of a website or application may be limited or individual services may not be available.
Currently the brightmind web application does not use any cookies and Brightworks Engineering plans to keep it this way as long as possible. You can validate this at any time by clicking the lock icon next to the URL in your browser. This will display a list of all cookies placed.
In some cases, (non-essential and non-functional) cookies from third-party companies may be stored on end devices when you enter their websites or applications (third-party cookies) provided for brightmind. These enable Brightworks Engineering to use certain services of the third-party company. Please check the cookie policy of such third-party service providers before accessing any subdomain with a brightmind and/or “mustermind” prefix.
As of October 2021, only external service provider Convas places one session cookie (_cfruid) when accessing mustermind.convas.io. Additional cookies will be placed after logging in. Please see Convas’ cookie policy (https://convas.io/cookie-policy) for more information. You can also delete individual cookies or the entire cookie inventory manually. Major browsers (Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Opera, Safari, etc.) provide instructions on how to manually delete cookies in their support or help documentation. Please follow the instructions of your respective browser, if you wish to delete cookies.
 
##  Individual right of objection (according to Art. 21 GDPR)
Irrespective of any changes to the data privacy policy, you have the right to object at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR. 
If you object, Brightworks Engineering and/or its data processors will no longer process your personal data unless compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms can be demonstrated, or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
Please send your objection or other questions regarding the privacy policy to the aforementioned responsible contact person.

## Changes to the privacy policy
Brightworks Engineering reserves the right to make changes to terms and/or its data privacy policy to ensure it always complies with the current legal requirements or in order to implement changes to its services in its data privacy policy, e.g. when introducing new services. New terms and privacy policy will then apply.
